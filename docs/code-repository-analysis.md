# Code Repository Analysis with DocuBot

DocuBot's code repository analysis feature allows you to analyze and chat with entire codebases. This guide explains how to effectively use this feature to explore, understand, and improve your code repositories.

> **Note**: The code repository analysis feature is currently in development and will be available soon. This documentation provides an overview of the planned functionality.

## Understanding Code Repository Analysis

Code repository analysis in DocuBot enables you to:

- Upload and analyze entire code repositories
- Chat with your codebase to understand functionality
- Find bugs and receive code improvement suggestions
- Generate tests for your code
- Search across your codebase efficiently

## Supported Repository Types

DocuBot will support repositories containing:

- Multiple programming languages
- Project configuration files
- Documentation files
- Test suites
- Git metadata

## How to Upload a Code Repository

Once available, you'll be able to upload code repositories in several ways:

### Method 1: Direct Upload (Zip Archive)

1. Navigate to the "Upload Repository" section in your dashboard
2. Select a ZIP file containing your code repository
3. Upload the archive
4. DocuBot will extract and process the files

### Method 2: GitHub Integration (Coming Soon)

1. Connect your GitHub account to DocuBot
2. Select repositories to analyze
3. DocuBot will clone and process the repository

## Repository Processing

When you upload a repository, DocuBot will:

1. Extract all files from the archive or clone
2. Identify file types and programming languages
3. Generate semantic embeddings of the code
4. Create a searchable index of the codebase
5. Build understanding of code relationships and structure

Processing time depends on repository size and complexity.

## Interacting with Your Code Repository

Once processed, you can interact with your repository in several ways:

### Chat Interface

Similar to document chat, you can ask questions about your code:

- "Explain how the authentication system works"
- "What does the User class do?"
- "Show me all API endpoints defined in the system"
- "What dependencies does this project have?"

### Code Search

Use natural language or regex to find code:

- "Find all functions that handle file uploads"
- "Show me where errors are logged"
- "Find usages of the DatabaseConnection class"

### Code Analysis

Request specific analysis of your code:

- "Identify potential memory leaks"
- "Find security vulnerabilities in the authentication system"
- "Suggest performance improvements for this algorithm"
- "Check for unused variables and functions"

## Viewing Code Files

When exploring repositories, you can:

1. Navigate the file structure
2. View individual files with syntax highlighting
3. Jump to specific functions or classes
4. See relationships between files

## Repository Visualization

DocuBot will provide visual representations of your code:

- **Dependency Graphs**: See how modules and files relate
- **Class Hierarchies**: Visualize object inheritance
- **Call Graphs**: Understand function call sequences
- **Heat Maps**: Identify complex or frequently changed code

## Best Practices for Code Repository Analysis

For optimal results:

1. **Include Documentation**: README files, comments, and docs help DocuBot understand context
2. **Organize Your Code**: Well-structured code is easier to analyze
3. **Focus Questions**: Ask specific questions rather than broad queries
4. **Use Iterative Exploration**: Start with high-level questions, then dive deeper
5. **Verify Suggestions**: Always review and test code suggestions before implementation

## Limitations to Be Aware Of

The code repository analysis will have some limitations:

- Very large repositories may take longer to process
- Dynamic code behavior might not be fully captured
- Custom or obscure frameworks may have limited recognition
- Generated code suggestions should be reviewed for quality and security

## Repository Privacy and Security

Your code repositories will be protected by:

- Encrypted storage and transfer
- Private access limited to your account
- No sharing of code with third parties
- Option to delete repositories when no longer needed

## Upcoming Features

Future versions of the code repository analysis will include:

- Pull request analysis
- Automatic documentation generation
- Code quality metrics
- Integration with development workflows
- Team collaboration on code reviews

## Subscription Requirements

The code repository analysis feature will be available on:

- **Developer Plan**: Full access (coming soon)
- **Professional Plan**: Limited repository size and features
- **Free Plan**: Not available

Stay tuned for announcements about when this feature becomes available!
