# Document Management in DocuBot

Effectively managing your documents is key to getting the most out of DocuBot. This guide covers all aspects of document management, from organizing your library to managing individual files.

## Your Document Library

The document library is the central hub for all your uploaded files. To access it:

1. Log in to your DocuBot account
2. Click on "My Documents" in the navigation menu
3. Your library will display all your uploaded documents

## Document Display Options

DocuBot offers two ways to view your document library:

### Grid View

- Shows documents as cards with preview icons
- Best for visual browsing
- Displays document names and icons

### List View

- Shows documents in a detailed list
- Includes file type, size, and action buttons
- Better for managing multiple documents

Toggle between these views using the Grid/List buttons in the top-right corner of your document library.

## Document Information

For each document in your library, DocuBot displays:

- **Document Name**: The filename of your uploaded document
- **File Type**: The format of your document (PDF, TXT, etc.)
- **File Size**: How much storage space the document occupies
- **Upload Date**: When the document was added to your library (visible in List View)
- **File Icon**: Visual indicator of the document type

## Document Actions

You can perform several actions on your documents:

### Viewing Documents

1. Click on any document in your library
2. The document will open in the document viewer
3. Use the document viewer to read and interact with your content

### Downloading Documents

1. Locate the document in your library
2. Click the "Download" button (or the download icon)
3. The original file will be saved to your device

### Deleting Documents (Professional Plan)

1. Find the document you want to remove
2. Click the "Delete" button (trash icon)
3. Confirm deletion when prompted
4. The document will be permanently removed from your library

> **Note**: Document deletion requires a Professional plan. Free plan users cannot delete documents but can upload new ones until reaching their document limit.

## Document Limits

DocuBot has document limits based on your subscription plan:

- **Free Plan**: Up to 5 documents
- **Professional Plan**: Up to 12 documents
- **Developer Plan**: Up to 50 documents (coming soon)

When you reach your document limit:

- You'll see a notification in your dashboard
- The upload button will direct you to the upgrade page
- Free users cannot delete documents to make space

## Organizing Your Documents

While DocuBot doesn't currently have folders or tags, you can organize your documents by:

1. **Naming Convention**: Use clear, descriptive names when uploading
2. **Sort Order**: Documents are sorted by upload date (newest first)
3. **Document Count**: The total number of documents is displayed in your library

## Document Sharing

Currently, DocuBot doesn't support direct document sharing between accounts. Instead:

1. Export your chat conversations to share insights
2. Download the original document for external sharing
3. Colleagues can upload their own copy of the document to their DocuBot account

## Browser Storage and Caching

DocuBot remembers your preferences:

- **View Mode**: Your chosen display mode (Grid/List) is saved between sessions
- **Document Position**: When viewing a document, your scroll position is preserved if you navigate away and return
- **Recent Activity**: Recently viewed documents are easier to access

## Document Security

Your documents in DocuBot are protected by:

- **Encryption**: All documents are encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Private Access**: Only you can access your uploaded documents
- **Secure Storage**: Files are stored in secure cloud infrastructure
- **Authentication**: Account login required to access your documents

## Best Practices for Document Management

1. **Use descriptive filenames** before uploading to easily identify documents
2. **Upload related versions** as separate documents if you need to compare them
3. **Prioritize important documents** when nearing your plan's document limit
4. **Download local backups** of critical documents
5. **Check file sizes** before uploading to stay within the 15MB limit

DocuBot is continuously improving. Upcoming document management features may include:

- Folders and tags for better organization
- Search functionality within your document library
- Favoriting documents for quick access
