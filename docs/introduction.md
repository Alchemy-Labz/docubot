# Introduction to DocuBot

Welcome to DocuBot, your AI-powered document companion! DocuBot transforms static documents into interactive conversations, making it easier to extract information and insights from your files.

## What is DocuBot?

DocuBot is an innovative platform that allows you to upload documents and chat with them using advanced AI technology. Instead of scrolling through pages of content to find specific information, you can simply ask questions and get answers directly from your documents.

## Key Features

- **Chat with Documents**: Upload PDFs, text files, and other document formats, then ask questions to get instant answers.
- **Code Repository Analysis**: Analyze entire code repositories to find bugs, get improvements, and more.
- **Document Management**: Organize and manage your documents in one place with easy search and filtering.

## How DocuBot Works

DocuBot uses cutting-edge AI technology to analyze and understand your documents. When you upload a file, the system:

1. Processes the document text
2. Creates vector embeddings using advanced language models
3. Stores this information in a specialized database
4. Makes the content available for natural language conversations

When you ask questions, DocuBot retrieves the most relevant information from your document and generates accurate answers based specifically on your content.
