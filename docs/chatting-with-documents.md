# Chatting with Your Documents

One of DocuBot's core features is the ability to have natural conversations with your documents. This guide explains how to effectively interact with your documents using DocuBot's AI-powered chat functionality.

## Accessing the Chat Interface

1. Log in to your DocuBot account
2. Navigate to "My Documents" on your dashboard
3. Click on any document in your library to open it
4. You'll see the document viewer with a chat interface (either in split view or as separate tabs)

## Chat Interface Layout

The chat interface consists of:

- **Document Viewer**: Displays your document (PDF, text, etc.)
- **Chat Window**: Where your conversation with the document appears
- **Message Input**: Text field at the bottom to type your questions
- **View Controls**: Options to switch between document-only, chat-only, or split view

## View Modes

DocuBot offers three viewing modes when chatting with documents:

1. **Split View**: Document and chat displayed side by side (or top/bottom on mobile)
2. **Document View**: Document displayed full-screen
3. **Chat View**: Chat interface displayed full-screen

You can switch between these modes using the buttons at the top of the interface.

## Starting a Conversation

To begin chatting with your document:

1. Type your question in the message input field at the bottom of the chat window
2. Press Enter or click the Send button (paper airplane icon)
3. DocuBot will analyze your document and provide an answer based on its content
4. Continue the conversation by asking follow-up questions

## Types of Questions You Can Ask

DocuBot excels at answering various types of questions about your documents:

### Factual Questions

- "What is the annual revenue mentioned in this report?"
- "When was this policy last updated?"
- "Who is the author of this document?"

### Summary Requests

- "Can you summarize the key points of this document?"
- "What are the main conclusions in the third section?"
- "Summarize the executive summary in bullet points."

### Analysis Requests

- "What are the pros and cons discussed in this proposal?"
- "Compare the different approaches mentioned in section 2."
- "What evidence is provided to support the main argument?"

### Location Queries

- "Where does the document discuss budget constraints?"
- "In which section can I find information about the methodology?"
- "Show me all mentions of climate change in this paper."

## Advanced Chat Techniques

For more effective document interactions:

### Be Specific

- Instead of: "Tell me about the project."
- Try: "What is the timeline for the Alpha project mentioned on page 3?"

### Reference Document Sections

- "What does the conclusion say about future research?"
- "Explain the data in Table 2 on page 15."

### Ask for Formatting

- "List the five key requirements in bullet points."
- "Organize the results into a structured summary."

### Multi-part Questions

- "What was the company's revenue in 2023, and how does it compare to 2022?"

## Message Limits

DocuBot has message limits based on your subscription plan:

- **Starter Plan**: 5 messages per document
- **Professional Plan**: 20 messages per document
- **Team Plan**: 50 messages per document

A counter will show how many messages you've used for each document.

## Understanding AI Responses

When DocuBot answers your questions:

- Responses are generated specifically from your document's content
- The AI doesn't access external information to answer questions
- If information isn't in your document, DocuBot will let you know
- Responses may include direct quotes and page references when available

## Chat History

Your conversation history is automatically saved and will be available when you return to the document. You can:

- Review previous questions and answers
- Continue conversations where you left off
- See timestamps on messages for reference

## Exporting Chat Conversations

To save or share your conversations:

1. Look for the export options in the chat interface
2. Select your preferred format (PDF, CSV, or JSON)
3. Download the exported file to your device

See the [Exporting Chats](exporting-chats.md) section for more details.

## Best Practices for Effective Document Chats

1. **Upload clean, text-searchable documents** for best results
2. **Ask clear, specific questions** rather than vague queries
3. **Break down complex inquiries** into smaller questions
4. **Use follow-up questions** to dive deeper into topics
5. **Reference specific sections** when possible
6. **Try different phrasings** if you don't get the answer you need initially

## Troubleshooting Chat Issues

If you encounter problems with document chat:

- Ensure the document was properly processed during upload
- Check that you haven't reached your message limit
- Try refreshing the page if responses are slow
- For documents with complex formatting, try more specific questions
